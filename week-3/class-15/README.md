  - Did everyone get local storage set up?
  - Anyone want to show off your charts, etc.?
  - Your goal for the charting app is to have it finished today and be done with it... from here on your focus should be on your projects.
2. Is there gonna be a test? Yep, there is. Right meow. Let's talk about it.

+++BREAK (earier than usual... starting 10:00ish to 10:15ish)+++

1. Final Project description
  - We'll go over it in detail this morning and take any questions.
  - Again, note that everyone MUST make significant contributions in each of HTML, CSS, and JS.
2. Second round of project pitches
  - Elevator pitches: "The name 'elevator pitch' reflects the idea that it should be possible to deliver the summary in the time span of an elevator ride, or approximately thirty seconds to two minutes and is widely credited to Ilene Rosenzweig and Michael Caruso (while he was editor for Vanity Fair) for its origin. The term itself comes from a scenario of an accidental meeting with someone important in the elevator. If the conversation inside the elevator in those few seconds is interesting and value adding, the conversation will either continue after the elevator ride, or end in exchange of business cards or a scheduled meeting." - Wikipedia
  - Elevator pitches are all verbal: no slides or other materials.
  - We'll keep a list of all proposals here in the repo for your review and consideration.
3. Set project teams! Ermahgerd!

## Today's task!

Finish the market analysis app and get it deployed; have an initial meeting with your project teams to plan your planning.
