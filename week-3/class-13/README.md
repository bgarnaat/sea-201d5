1. A couple of topics that do not directly connect to your assignments, but still should be in your knowledge base going forward... kind of a 301 topics preview
  * Abstraction
  * The Wonders of the Req-Res Cycle

## Today's task, same as yesterday's: display your results in a chart!

Using ChartJS, display your vote totals in a bar chart. If you want to try some additional chart types, do so with some of your alternate data that you have calculated from your vote results. The size and look of your chart is up to you, just be sure to put it in the area beneath the three images.

# User Stories

Be sure to add any additional user stories related to your charts. And, revisit your user stories and consider adapting them or refining them based upon what we saw in class today.
