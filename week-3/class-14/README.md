## Week 2 - Daily Plans
### Class 14 (Thursday)
1. Announcements
  - It's almost Project Week. Prep your pitches!
    * First project pitches will be **TODAY** during class
    * Second round of project pitches **TOMORROW** during class
    * Projects selected and teams set **TOMORROW** during class
  - How did yesterday go with getting projects & charts operational? Any questions/concerns/things to review? Anyone want to show off what they have?
  - For those that did the extra-credit assignment on linting, how did that go? Any questions or anything to look at or talk about? Anyone want to demo?
  - How DRY is your code? How many lines? Any particular pieces of refactoring you'd like to show?
2. Final Project description
  - We'll go over it briefly this morning; you can read it in detail and bring any questions tomorrow.
  - Note that everyone MUST make significant contributions in each of HTML, CSS, and JS.
3. First round of project pitches
  - Elevator pitches: "The name 'elevator pitch' reflects the idea that it should be possible to deliver the summary in the time span of an elevator ride, or approximately thirty seconds to two minutes and is widely credited to Ilene Rosenzweig and Michael Caruso (while he was editor for Vanity Fair) for its origin. The term itself comes from a scenario of an accidental meeting with someone important in the elevator. If the conversation inside the elevator in those few seconds is interesting and value adding, the conversation will either continue after the elevator ride, or end in exchange of business cards or a scheduled meeting." - Wikipedia
  - Elevator pitches are all verbal: no slides or other materials.
  - We'll keep a list of all proposal here in the repo for your review and consideration.
  - You'll have an opportunity to do a revised pitch tomorrow if you have new ideas or modifications in the next 24 hours.

1. Local Storage & Persistence

## Today's task!

Add local storage to your project so that all of your data is saved even over refreshes and browser quits. Protip: for your work process, give yourself a button you can use to quickly purge local storage.

# User Stories

Be sure to add any additional user stories related to using local storage in your projects, basically that you can reset the evaluation for individual users and keep track of all of the cumulative data even after shutting down at the end of each day. And, revisit your user stories and consider adapting them or refining them based upon what we saw in class today.
