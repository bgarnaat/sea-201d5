# Student Comments from Week 2

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

* I liked that we were working on one project the entire week that allowed us to experiment and fine tune out code for specific goals. The collaborative environment was great too.

* This week was a practical demonstration of two important aspects of writing code. First, always plan your code to be modular to facilitate changes and scaling easily and second, project requirements will change during the project and the more code is written to accommodate this (modular) the easier it is to accommodate changes.

* Code review was the most helpful for me this week.

* The lab time where we were able to get help with the TAs when needed and work on the items we just freshly covered.

* Just digging into it. I spent a lot of time looking at resources before I coded. The more sandboxey setup really worked well with me. Also the code reviews were really helpful.

* The demo on event listeners was very helpful. Also, as with last week, I am finding the lab time to be very productive.

* The buffer days to rework our code was very helpful and the code review.

* I really like the assigned project as it is a good simulation of what a real world client might be like. This project combined all of the topics from the readings and put them into practice . The code reviews of other students' work I found really helpful as well.

* It was a difficult one and laid on thick, but I am starting to see the benefits of the "stack method". Things are starting to even out for me and "clicking". The most helpful were the TA's and fellow students to talk things through with in figuring out the logic behind the processes rather than just trying to get it to work.

* I found the posting of a "solution" to a lab assignment and different example codes helpful.

* The lecture, code-review, and hands-on help in lab are all excellent.

* The assignments provided were a good way to get a handle on the different topics for this week. The additional time to finish things up on Friday was also helpful.

* The lab time is where I do most of my learning, just like the week before. Other than learning from classmates and experimenting I would have to say the Friday lecture (pretty sure it was Friday) where we did the code review for Ron's project, was really helpful. I really wish we did more stuff like this. Not just the code review, but breaking down really good code that answers a question everyone understands.

* The code review in class done by Sam was the most helpful for me.

* I think both the lectures and labs are great. I like learning from both the TAs and the other students in lab. I think it would be great if we did more code review in lecture. Maybe I'm the only one who thinks this, but I could benefit from some more step by step dissection of code.

* I found the individual work with TAs and working through code demos to be the most helpful. I thought that overviews of chapters that we read were useful but the what helped me the most was implementing that content either with the class or individually in lab. Also Flex-box is a god send.

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

* I just wish we had gone over tables a little more in lecture or maybe an active demo with the class following along. Our project was so heavily based off a table but when we started it felt like a lot of us were taking shots in the dark.

* All topics covered this week seemed important and were exercised during lab time to develop website.

* Lecture was least helpful for me this week. I don't think it was because of how the material was presented, but that I learn so much more from doing than I do from listening.

* This week was much better with less class time spent on book review and more time spent on code review.

* I didn't really have anything this week that was unhelpful. I am just finding it more productive to learn and work during the lab time.

* The pace for me was way too fast between figuring out the code for the project and trying to stay current on the reading assignments. It was just a ton of material that I couldn't absorb all at once. I just felt stressed out and behind the whole week.

* Code review of our classmates work was a mixed bag. If your methodology differentiated enough it wasn't ultra useful. Sometimes there were gems but I'd like it if Sam showed us how he'd accomplish the goals as well.

* We need a bit more discipline in covering the intended topics. Often we spent the first few hours on Q&A and by the time we covered new material I was starving, mind-numbed and easily distracted. Make better use of the first couple of hours, and don't get distracted by tangents!

* The initial CSS training was not delivered well. While I think it's important to give the assistant teacher opportunities to practice being a lead, I don't think he should be the one to deliver the first-ever view of a new topic (as was the case with the CSS portion). I ended up watching tutorial videos instead so I could get a good grasp of the topics covered.

* I thought the first couple of days (Tuesday and Wednesday) were the least helpful because I was stuck doing things that I had no idea how to do. I understand the 'sandbox' concept but if we don't know how to do something that is already really complicated, staring at a computer for 4 hours isn't helpful. If we could get more specific code instruction (like we did the day we created forms) than I could see the 'sandbox' concept being more of a reality. Understanding our tools and then being creative with how we use them is one thing but trying to piece together how a tool even works and then being told to use it doesn't seem like the most effective way of teaching. I really feel like I learned a lot from the code review on Friday but defiantly think we should have been doing that early in the week so we had a better idea on what 'great' code looks like.

* some of the css presentations

* I can't think of anything this week that wasn't helpful in some way.

* I felt like our pair programming was a useful refresher of how to fork but the process of creating the html form together didn't seem like a process that warranted two minds working on it.

### DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

* My primary concern is I feel like there are quite a few times where there's an abundance of time given to admin items with the class, and the actual instruction/explanation on new code (how the functions work, not the projects) we are learning is quickly brushed over.

* My brain is fried. I haven't used it this much in a long time. Sometimes I just let my eyes go out of focus while I am typing because it takes too much effort to keep my full attention on the screen.

* No other comments.

* I think having a code-along with the demos Sam is going over might be helpful. I think actually typing on my laptop and following the logic will help me understand better and remember the material.

* Overall, the class is really good. The hands-on lab time is extremely valuable. It would help me a lot if there was some time spent on how to make your code easier to debug. General work-flow guidance would be useful too.

* I feel time management is something that needs improvement. We constantly go over scheduled time blocks and end up with little time for crucial overviews (our initial overview of JS events is an example of this, we spent very little time on it because we went over the scheduled time for code review earlier in the morning). This seems to be partly due to unnecessary tangents or spending too much time on code review, while this is sometimes helpful it seems to be cutting into the rest of the work.

* I would really enjoy more in depth code instruction and concept definition. If we had more examples of 'great' code and understand the problem this code is solving, then go through it step by step and really talk about the concepts of what is happening, I feel our time would be better spent. Ron's code review portion of the Friday lecture was great I hope we can do more review like that. Excited for another challenging week

* It was a tough week for me so by mid-week I felt very overwhelmed and a little disheartened, however Sam set it up so that by the end of the week I felt like I had a grasp on everything (except CSS but even that is much better with flex-box). HUZZAH!
