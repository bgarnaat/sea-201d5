# Assignment for Class
Today in lab you will be doing some work in a pair, and some work individually. In the paired work, you will be adding an input form to your partner's data page. In the individual work, you will be working with your own data page to wire up the form with JavaScript and use it to update your table data.

**Note:** For the pair programming piece, please refer back to our previous pair programming work from last week for more details on how to get your partner's code set up on your machine (i.e. the fork, clone, and PR process).

## User Stories (MVP)
  * REMINDER: All of the user stories from yesterday remain our primary objectives
  * (Pair programming) As a developer, I want to implement a form on the website, so Jo will have the ability to enter new stores without a developer to help her.
  * (Individual) As a developer, I want to implement event management on my page, so that my form will listen and react to 'submit' events. NOTE: Thou Shalt Not Use 'onClick()'
  * As a developer, I want to present the store data in a table format on the webpage, so each store's data is easier to represent and understand

## Technical Requirements
  * Table has been implemented and lists are no longer used to represent store data
  * Working on a non-master branch for the day, with regular commit history
  * Form properly implemented in the html
  * Events have been wired up with *event listeners* and *event handlers* and are rendering new store data to the page

## User Stories (Stretch)
  * As a developer, I want the business owner to be able to update data for kiosks that are already presented on the page, in the place where they are already listed.
