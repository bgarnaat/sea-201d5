# WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

### GIT

Continuous practice with git/github. More practice with creating / using / merging branches and add / commit / push / merge will be very helpful to build best practices.

Learning about git has been a real help--I didn't know how to use it before, and I didn't understand why I might want to use it, especially if I were working on solo projects. Now I feel much more comfortable with it, and while I am obviously not a git 'ninja,' I feel like I can use it somewhat comfortably.

### PAIR PROGRAMMING

I was wary of the pair programming, but it has actually been really rewarding. It is like getting double the work in the same amount of time, and forces you to solve problems that wouldn't have come up if you were only working on code you have developed.

Working with a Partner that had a strong grasp of the material was beneficial because they were able to coach me through it as we worked, I am nervous for the day that I have to be the smart one and try and guide someone.

The pair programming exercise was really great, with lots of learning.

The peer programming assignments helped push me further in my understanding and my communication ability.

### GENERAL

The lab hours have been the most useful part.

Very helpful and knowledgable TA's, great teacher, SLACK is super awesome and many of the alumni are very helpful and help is easily and readily obtained by using this one of many resources supplied to us by code fellows

This has been such a great learning experience so far. I was kind of intimidated before joining but everyone has been super helpful and collaborative.

The labs are definitely where I've learned the most. Pair programming can be frustrating at times but working in teams has helped me learn faster than if I was alone.

During the morning and class time having the concepts presented, and then going through and putting them in code.

Also, all the little tidbits about how to code professionally, like style conventions, are extremely helpful.

I really enjoy each step in the process. I love that we are able to have a mildly short lecture time, then right into hands on training. I find that combination enables the most conducive learning situations. I love how we are able to see the instructor notes/videos as well.

The hands-on time with TAs and the instructor during lab.

I found lectures in class to be most helpful this week.

I wouldn't have been able to do the lab well without the lectures but I actually found the lab time most helpful. Its wonderful to have the time to explore different methods will assistance just at my finger tips.

I enjoyed it when we worked example code in class and when I was able to code along with Sam.

The example we do in class and the ta support in lab.

Slack is awesome as well as the lab time with all of the TAs there to help

I think lab time is very constructive. It allows us to apply everything we've been learning.

The hands on exercises (lab work) has been the most helpful so far. Being able to actually sit down and work on things makes me feel like I'm starting to retain the stuff were learning about in our reading and lectures.

The labs have been the most helpful because we get to put the concepts and other things we learned such as Git and the Command line into practice. In addition, having the TAs and instructors available during lab is a great resource because I can ask them questions and they will help you arrive at an answer without giving you the answer. I really like that we are being showed best practices and proper coding conventions. This is something that is much more difficult to learn if I were learning on my own.

Visual diagrams drawn by instructor are really helpful as well as going over some of the reading in class, but most of all the on hands learning has been really helpful.

Doing the Code Academy tutorials familiarizes you with the material and the prescribed books are surprisingly good. I have read many coding books and most do not explain concepts well.

# WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

### NOT ENOUGH BIG PICTURE

Flowcharting and pseudocode were only very briefly touched on but not enough to be useful topic if you weren't familiar with them already. When working with / along side several other individuals in lab, having pseudocode to get out ideas and replacing small pieces at a time with actual code maybe assist new learners when trying to create, add, or modify existing code (what do you have, what do you want, how do you get there). When dealing with more complex code it will be incredibly useful to map out code and goals before beginning to write code.

So far, the content of the class has been about 90% review for me, so I've been fairly bored in lecture and finishing the labs pretty early. Pretty much the only HTML/CSS and JavaScript I've done has been the prep work for this class, Code101 and the codecademy tutorials. I understand that this week is trying to make sure everyone has a certain base level of understanding, so they are likely to make it through the rest f 201. I've learned a few things and gotten much better with gitHub and git, but am definitely looking for much more of a challenge moving forward.

### THE BOOK-LEARNIN' GETS TEDIOUS AND REPETITIVE

The review of the reading sections in class can get a little repetitive, but I think that is because we are doing the easy sections of the book. In harder sections, I can see how it would be nice to dive into the harder topics more.

The book review in class. I understand why we do it, but I guess I expect that we all read before hand.

Not the biggest fan of just going over the book. I prefer demos in the code or console.

Sometimes during the lecture I feel like we go over topics that the students should know if they're doing the reading. During these times I don't feel like I'm learning as much but over all everything has been educational.

### PACE IS TOO SLOW

I know I'll regret saying this, but the first week moved a bit slow.

I found that lectures went a bit slower at times then I though was necessary but, just as I would get bored we would have a new topic come up and this would re-invigorate my learning.

It seems like we go over the readings pretty thoroughly in class, so reading the textbook seperately seems a bit repetitive.

There's a of really simple things, like lists, that are for now really simple formatting things. I think we might have skipped lists in class, but there were a few others that we spent a long time on that seemed like they could have been gone over more quickly with the option to look up the nitty-gritty details of formatting later.

### PAIR PROGRAMMING... NOT LOVING IT

Pair coding, while I understand and see the use of it, starting out and having different people at different levels can be much much more time consuming.

I really didn't like how we were introduced to unfamiliar concepts and then had to work on someone else's code before working on our own. I understand the idea behind making you work on someone's else's code but I thought it was too soon. There was a lot of lab time spent trying to explain my code to someone else and vice versa, instead of fully grasping the new concepts.

I love/hate the partnering. I know it will help me in the long run.

### GIT

For total beginners on git, it would have been welcomed to have more guidance on this.

I think the github training wasn't in depth enough - perhaps that's just because I'm having trouble there - but I think we could have had more explanation as to how it works.

### GENERAL

When working on examples, it would be better if the instructor scrolled down so the current code being written could be seen by the back of the class and is not blocked by the people in the front row. It made it harder to follow along.

Rushing through class because we spent too much time on Q&A or discussions only to discover an explanation of concepts would have been helpful for our lab exercises.

# DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

### GIT

Stress (or mention on/for/during lab assignments?) creation of a separate branch than master to work on and when finished with changes to branch merge back to master. (previously not merging to master caused several issues during push / pull / merge on Fri, 1/8. good experience of why this should be done and how to fix it though)

### FACILITIES

get power to right side (when facing front of classroom) of Easy classroom without stretching power strip across aisle (safety hazard?). The one set of power receptacles hanging from emergency light do not appear to be functioning.

The basement level classrooms (both the Hardy and Easy) get cold and drafty (but this seems to be a Winter issue primarily). It's not a big deal however since I can just layer up.

### PACING

With the pre-work done in code academy, I feel like a lot of the material we could have gone through a bit faster. With that said, I do understand it's imperative to have a solid understanding of the basics.

In general it just feels like the class is moving a little bit slow, but I'm sure that it will pick up as the course moves forward.

One suggestion is to keep better manage of time. I understand some topics require more attention, but covering enough topics in a day, rather than doubling down the following day would be appreciated.

### SCHEDULING

Id suggest posting all the assignments to canvas or github, so that we can preview where we will be in a couple weeks

I would like if could get the schedule of the assigned readings a few days in advance. That way we can plan ahead and maybe practice some concepts before they are reviewed in class in more depth. I would also suggest providing the students the slide deck beforehand when being used for the day as well.

### CLASS SIZE

I have a feeling that our class size is one of the largest you guys have seen here. How do you guys plan on ensuring that even with our group size, we are all still getting the same level of education and mediation as a small group?

I feel like the class is too big and a ration of 5 TA's per 20 student students would be better.

### GENERAL

It would be nice if the TAs didn't talk about how awful wk 2 was going to be all during wk 1. It was something they said constantly and I just don't think that is very helpful.

So far I'm really enjoying the tasks and learning with my classmates. The lab's are great learning experience. I would like to cover more complex topics/algorithms in the lecture if possible. I just want to know so much information and have it mastered quickly which I know isn't possible in week one. I'll have more feedback next week but I'm really enjoy everything so far.

Is there a way to set up a meeting with someone who can help me with the decision I have to make on what 401 I want to try for? At the moment I'm trying to decide between Javascript and Python and I am not sure which one fits best for my particular skills and interests.

Lead instructor should have a meeting with the TAs between 12-1 so everyone is on the same page.

I wish there was a little more time going over commands on the terminal and how to use it along with Atom and github. The biggest thing for me is getting comfortable with github and being able to learn how to navigate from different repos and files between the three.
