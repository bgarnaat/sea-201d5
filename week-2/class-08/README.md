# Assignment for Class
Today will be a day of refining the business-side data page and building out more of the public-facing page! Your client has changed her mind on a few things (get used to it!), well... actually a lot of things... so that drops more work on your plate. All of the user stories for the week to this point are now collected and updated to reflect the current state of development of the site

## User Stories (MVP)

  * As a business owner, I want...
  * As a developer, I want...
  * As a customer, I want...

* As a business owner, I want a specific set of images that I've chosen to be featured on the site.
* As a business owner, I want to begin selling merchandise such as mugs and clothing in addition to coffee, both in retail locations and on the website, but I need assistance with the design aspects.

* As a developer, I want to implement a constructor function, so that I can reuse code and eliminate much of the duplication in my JavaScript
* As a developer, I want to utilize CSS and images to develop an attractive brand for the company, including a logo and a color scheme that can be utilized in both the website and on company-themed merchandise.
* As a developer, I want be sure that the public-facing page contains all information that customers would typically seek at a business's website (addresses, hours, contact information, etc.).
* As a developer, I want to present the store data in a table format on the webpage, so each store's data is easier to represent and understand
* As a developer, I want to provide Jo with some basic placeholder text ([lorem ipsum](http://www.lipsum.com)), so that she can see her site populated without having to write content.

## Technical Requirements
* Object-Oriented Programming using a constructor function and object instances
* Good and proper use of HTML 5
* Home page has been professionally styled with CSS
* Photos from the assets folder (see Helpful Resources) have been used to enhance and style the main page
* Local events, store specifics (phone, address, etc), and camping resources have been listed on the page
* Good use of Lorem Ipsum to provide placeholder content for the site

## User Stories (Stretch)
* As a developer, I want to ensure that this site looks as professional as possible, using CSS, so I can use this as a portfolio piece
* As a user, I want to be able to add a new store to my webpage, so that I have the ability to work independently of my developer. This is a LARGE HUGE BIG stretch goal. There will be Forms and Events involved, which you are welcome to read ahead on and try to implement. We're not going to cover these in class until Thursday.
