# Week 2, Class 7

# Reading Reminder
* [“Document Object Model” (JavaScript, Ch. 5)]()

# Today's plan
1. Review a solution of yesterday's assignment
2. Go over JS Ch. 5 "DOM"
3. Demo: using a constructor function
4. Demo: HTML tables

# Assignment for class
In class, we learned how to refactor our cookie stand objects using a constructor and instances. Let's replace your object literals with a single constructor that when called with 'new', creates new instances. See pages 106-109 in your textbook for an example... and especially focus on 108 and 109.

We will also be replacing the lists of data for each store, and implementing a table of data instead!

## User Stories (MVP)
 - As a developer, I want to implement a constructor function, so that I can reuse code and eliminate much of the duplication in my JavaScript
- As a user, I want coffee sales data represented in tables rather than lists

## Technical Requirements
 - Good use of a constructor function; style and syntax are correctly implemented
 - Duplicate code has been removed and DRY principles are evident
 - Working on a non-master branch for the day, with regular commit history

## User Stories (Stretch)
 - As a user, I want to be able to add a new store to my webpage, so that I have the ability to work independently of my developer. This is a LARGE HUGE BIG stretch goal. There will be Forms and Events involved, which you are welcome to read ahead on and try to implement. We're not going to cover these in class until Thursday.
