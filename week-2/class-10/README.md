# Week 2, Class 10

# Today's plan

1. Code review. And some more Code Review. Until we can't Code Review any more. But then we'll still do more Code Review. Because we can. We'll Code Review like a wrecking ball.

--BREAK--

1. More code review? CAN HAZ RVU PLZ?
2. Flexbox with Paul starts at 10:45, be there or be square.
3. Twitter with Bella
4. Extra topic if time allows? This could also go immediately after the break depending on code review.

# Assignment for Class

It's time to get all of the finishing touches on the Campfire Coffee project. So, from here, you want to work on getting all of the pieces finished and refined. Here's the definition of your *MVP* (Minimum Viable Product):

The site has two pages (plus any supporting JS and CSS files, and a README that should read like a journal of your work to this point):

  * index.html - This is the public-facing page. It should contain all of the individual pieces that Jo asked for.
  * data.html - This page provides a table (tables?) of useful information to the business owner. The page should receive input from a form and create new data as a result.

## Deploy!
It's time to deploy the living site! When all work is finished and the master branch has merged in all edits to this point, and is also in sync with GitHub, from the master branch `git checkout -b gh-pages` to create a deployment branch, and push this branch to GitHub. Once you do that, you're live!

## User Stories (MVP)
 - As a developer, I want my website hosted online, so people can actually see it and enjoy my badassery.
 - As a developer, I want to ensure that I've met all of the requirements of my client, so that I get paid for the amazing work I've done!

## Technical Requirements
 - The finished product has been pushed to gh-pages and deployed version is available.
 - The problem domain has been fully satisfied and Jo is a happy *camper*!
